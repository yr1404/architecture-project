### CPU Cache Visualizer

Visualization of CPU cache line activities while running through an arbitrary instructions. A cache hit will result in a green pulse, and a cache miss will result of a red pulse at specific cache lines.

This was an extension of the CPU cache simulator project for an ECE course project.
